The Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster competition on Kaggle is a classic introductory challenge for data science and machine learning. The goal of this competition is to predict the survival of passengers aboard the RMS Titanic, which sank in the North Atlantic Ocean after hitting an iceberg on its maiden voyage in 1912.

Objective
The objective of this challenge is to build a predictive model that determines whether a passenger survived the sinking of the Titanic based on certain features such as age, gender, class, and other personal information.

Dataset
The dataset consists of two files:

train.csv: This file contains information about a subset of the passengers on board (including whether they survived or not). This is the dataset used to train the model.
test.csv: This file contains similar information but without the survival information, which is what you are trying to predict.

Goal
Using the provided training data, you need to build a machine learning model that can predict the survival status (1 for survived, 0 for not survived) of passengers in the test dataset.
